# Smartmail+

Smartmail+ is an AI-powered Gmail add-on that automatically generates reply emails based on:
- **attitude** (e.g. positive, negative)
- **reason** (e.g. delay, decline, accept)
- **scenario** (e.g. business, personal)

You can also create **custom reply templates** using your own logic.
